This program is intended for cleaning android studio projects/folders using the ./gradlew.bat file that comes inside every project folder.

You can use it to clean multiple folders at once using the mouse selection.

In order to work, JDK must be defined in your project or you must have it set in your computer (like the JAVA_HOME variable). It may have some problems depending on the java jdk version you are using.
